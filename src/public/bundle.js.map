In React, a fresh constructor is created, then all mixins are mixed in recursively,\n\t  // then the actual spec is mixed in last.\n\t  //\n\t  // With ES6 classes, the properties are already there, so smart-mixin mixes functions (a, b) -> b()a(), which is\n\t  // the opposite of how React does it. If we reverse this array, we basically do the whole logic in reverse,\n\t  // which makes the result the same.
